## Bio
My Name is Dylan Medina, Ph.D. I am your instructor for Concepts in Computing and Everyday Coding. My past research has focused on writing and how learning works in the writing classroom. Presently I focus on the ways in which digital technology affects the way that the world exists for people. 

I love teaching Python because it's fun and provides students in cultural studies with a useful gateway into the field of technology and technology studies.
